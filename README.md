# ðŸ¤— Transformers.js Benchmarking

A versatile toolkit designed to measure and compare the performance of Transformers.js/ONNX models across various environments, including: in-browser (WASM, WebGPU, WebNN), Node.js, Bun, or Deno.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Platform Support:** Benchmark models directly in-browser (WASM, WebGPU, WebNN) as well as in server-side environments like Node.js, Bun, and Deno.
- **Efficient Model Ops Collection:** Streaming-based collection functionality to efficiently gather model operations without needing to download entire models.

## Getting Started

1. **Run Benchmarks**
    - web ([online demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/onnx-internal-testing/transformers.js-benchmarking)):
        ```sh
        cd packages/web/
        npm i
        npm run dev
        ```

    - Node.js
        ```sh
        cd packages/node/
        npm i
        node index.js
        ```

    - Bun
        ```sh
        cd packages/bun/
        bun install
        bun run index.ts
        ```

2. **(Optional) Prepare model operations**
   Download and build model operations with:

   ```sh
   npm run build:architectures
   ```

## Repository Structure
```
â”œâ”€â”€ packages
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ core         # Core engine powering the benchmarking suite.
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ web          # User-friendly web interface for running benchmarks.
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ node         # CLI tailored for Node.js environments.
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ bun          # CLI support specifically built for Bun.
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts          # Utility scripts for tasks like collecting model operations.
â””â”€â”€ data             # Repository and model operation files (e.g., model_ops.csv).
```
